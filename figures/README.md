## Navigation

The structure is the same as in the thesis itself, i.e. figures and tables are identified by indexing. Each chapter has its own folder and each figure or table has itself an own folder. (To give an example, the plots of Figure 3.4 of the thesis are found in `/figures/chapter_3/figure_3.4/`). 

The corresponding files for each figure or table inside of these folders are prefixed with their respective language code. (E.g. `/figures/chapter_3/figure_3.4/TR_3.4` contains the plot of Figure 3.4 in the thesis for Turkish.) Files suffixed `a` and `b` correspond to the left and right panel of the respective figure; tabular data suffixed with `a` and `b` corresponds to the different parts of the corresponding table in the thesis.
